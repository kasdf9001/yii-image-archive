# yii-image-archive

This is my engineering thesis for a government department.

## Things worth noting

### Database
- Requires a SQL database
- Actual image files are stored in filesystem, not in the database
- Database structure is outdated by modern standards

### Compatibility
- Only works with Firefox
- Requires Yii 1.1.*

### Language
- Only Finnish is present
